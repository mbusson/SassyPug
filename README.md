# SassyPug

SassyPug is a Javascript application boilerplate derived from [Baptiste Briel](https://github.com/baptistebriel/)'s [biggie](https://github.com/baptistebriel/biggie), itself based on [bigwheel](https://github.com/bigwheel-framework), a minimalist framework from [Jam3](http://www.jam3.com/). SassyPug is basically biggie with a few variations in features, as you can read in the next section.

Oh, by the way, [**we have a wiki**](https://github.com/mbusson/SassyPug/wiki)!

## Features

- [x] Pug & Sass preprocessing
- [x] GSAP native implementation
- [x] Browserify, babelify & uglify Javascript files (automatically uses `build/app.js` for dev, `build/app.min.js` for prod)
- [x] Live linting of Javascript files (default: ES6, minimal semi-colon usage)
- [x] Optimize all assets (CSS, JS, fonts, and images) for production
- [x] Livereload (refreshes the browser automatically whenever you save a file)
- [x] Offer a stable and simple structure to manage and animate your contents
- [x] Fancy utilities from biggie described in Part.3 of the Tutorial

## Tutorial

I would strongly recommend you read our Tutorial before getting started with SassyPug.
Also, please be aware you need a basic understanding of object-oriented Javascript to use the boilerplate.
